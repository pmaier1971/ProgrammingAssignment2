## The following two functions cache the inverse of a matrix.
##     makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
##    cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## The inverse of the matrix is  be done using the solve function.


##  This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setSolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getSolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setSolve = setSolve,
       getSolve = getSolve)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve 
## retrieves the inverse from the cache.
## Note: The function assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getSolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setSolve(m)
  m
}
